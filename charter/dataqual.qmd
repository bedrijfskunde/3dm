## Problem description

![CRISP DM Framework [@noauthor_cross-industry_2023]](https://www.datascience-pm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CRISP-DM.png){#fig-crispdm .m-5 .w-75 onclick="toggleImageSize(\"fig-crispdm\")" title="Click to enlarge" style="cursor: zoom-in;"}

Data analytics involves a crucial process of evaluating and enhancing the quality of source data. While manual assessment suffices for small datasets, the task becomes arduous as data volume and variety expand. To address this challenge, the project customer aims to enhance the efficiency of their data preparation procedures through the following initiatives:

1.  Automated quality assessment: Implementing automated techniques to evaluate the quality of input data, enabling swift identification of anomalies or inconsistencies.

2.  Smart quality improvements: Leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to intelligently rectify data quality issues, streamlining the data cleansing and enrichment process.

3.  Auto-generated exploratory data analysis: Employing automated tools to generate insightful exploratory data analysis, providing valuable insights and uncovering patterns or trends within the data.

4.  Secure data access: Ensuring that data is accessed only by authorized individuals or systems in a protected and controlled manner.

By adopting these measures, the project customer aims to optimize their data preparation workflows, ensuring higher data quality and accelerating the overall data analytics process.

## Facilities

The project customer fully supports this project and offers:

-   A secure work environment with comprehensive guidance and coaching.

-   Remote work opportunities for international participants.

-   Access to essential facilities, including domain experts, technology, systems, and data.

-   Room for exploration and experimentation.
