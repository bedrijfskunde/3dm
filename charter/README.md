# Data Analytics for Supply Chains

![](logo.png)

## Introduction

This project aims to utilize data analytics techniques to optimize supply chain operations. By analyzing and interpreting various data points, we can gain valuable insights that help streamline processes, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance decision-making within the supply chain.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Collect and aggregate data from various sources, such as ERP systems, inventory databases, transportation logs, and customer feedback.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Perform data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Utilize descriptive analytics methods to summarize and visualize supply chain data, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and patterns.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Apply predictive analytics algorithms to forecast demand, optimize inventory levels, and anticipate supply chain disruptions.
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Utilize prescriptive analytics techniques to generate actionable recommendations for improving supply chain processes, such as optimal routing, inventory allocation, and production scheduling.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Create interactive dashboards to present key supply chain metrics and insights in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations for stakeholders, providing clear and concise summaries of the analysis results.
- **Data Security and Privacy:** Implement appropriate data security measures to protect sensitive information throughout the analytics process.
