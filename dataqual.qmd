## Introduction

![](https://www.datascience-pm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CRISP-DM.png)

An essential step in data analytics is assessing and ameliorating the quality of source data. With small data sets this is a tedious task which however can be done manually. As data volume and variety increases more automation is required. The project customer wants to improve the efficiency of its data preparation processes:

1.  Automated quality assessment of input data
2.  Smart quality improvements using RPA and AI
3.  Auto-generated exploratory data analysis

## Resources
