## Introduction

![](https://www.datascience-pm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CRISP-DM.png)

Data analytics involves a crucial process of evaluating and enhancing the quality of source data. While manual assessment suffices for small datasets, the task becomes arduous as data volume and variety expand. To address this challenge, the project customer aims to enhance the efficiency of their data preparation procedures through the following initiatives:

1. Automated quality assessment: Implementing automated techniques to evaluate the quality of input data, enabling swift identification of anomalies or inconsistencies.

2. Smart quality improvements: Leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to intelligently rectify data quality issues, streamlining the data cleansing and enrichment process.

3. Auto-generated exploratory data analysis: Employing automated tools to generate insightful exploratory data analysis, providing valuable insights and uncovering patterns or trends within the data.

By adopting these measures, the project customer aims to optimize their data preparation workflows, ensuring higher data quality and accelerating the overall data analytics process.

    <p class="card-text">This video discusses the application of AutoML Natural Language in solving various problems related to text data. It highlights use cases such as entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and text classification. Entity extraction helps identify known entities in documents, such as people, companies, and locations. Sentiment analysis determines the emotional opinion within text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. Text classification is useful for categorizing incoming user reports, such as bug reports, billing issues, or feedback.</p>
